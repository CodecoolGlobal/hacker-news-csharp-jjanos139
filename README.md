# Hacker News

My task was to create a website where we can see the freshest news in the hacker world using the [Hacker News API](https://api.hnpwa.com/v0)
The project is written in ASP.NET MVC. The main page uses the MVC View, however the rest of page has been updated to Javascript to experiment a bit more.
To start the project you can use the start-app.bat (on Windows platform) and go to https://localhost:5001/.

On the main landing page you can see the top news with some basic info and a clickable link. Click the names in the navbar to change the topic. You can also use the Previous/Next buttons to navigate between the rest of the news that weren't available on the landing page.

I have learned and furthered my knowledge in the following topics:

- Serialize data to JSON
- Call an API from the backend
- Multi-server systems
